Memory reduction: LoRA reduces the memory requirement of the model during training, allowing for more adapters to be used, which can improve performance.\\n2. Device-specific optimization: LoRA allows for training multiple models tailored to different device configurations or determining the optimal rank for each device and task, which can lead to improved performance.\\n3. Weight quantization: LoRA mitigates the performance degradation caused by weight quantization in large language models (LLMs) by fine-tuning additional adapters for downstream tasks, sometimes yielding notable performance enhancements.\\n4. Information recovery: LoRA can recover some of the lost information during the weight quantization process, leading to improved performance in some cases.'}},\n",
