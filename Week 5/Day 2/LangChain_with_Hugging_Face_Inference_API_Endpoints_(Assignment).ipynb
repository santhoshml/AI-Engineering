Minor memory benefits: Although reducing the amount of LoRA parameter yields only minor memory benefits, LoRA can use more adapters to improve the memory requirement of the model during training.\\n3. Optimal rank for each device and task: LoRA allows for choosing between training multiple models tailored to different device configurations or determining the optimal rank for each device and task, but this process is costly and time-consuming, even when using techniques like LoRA.\\n4. Passing through fixed pretrained model weights: LoRA passes the fixed pretrained model weights to the adapter, which is updated to optimize the loss function.\\n5. Mitigating performance degradation: LoRA mitigates the performance degradation caused by weight quantization in LLM by fine-tuning additional adapters for downstream tasks, sometimes even yielding notable performance enhancements.\\n6.
