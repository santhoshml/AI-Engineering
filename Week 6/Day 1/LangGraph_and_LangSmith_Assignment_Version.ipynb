        "### Why Cycles?\n",

        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effetively allowing us to recreate appliation flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",

        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

        "`coordinated multi-actor and stateful applications`\n",
        "\n",
        "So what does that \"stateful\" mean?\n",
        "\n",
        "To put it simply - we want to have some kind of object which we can pass around our application that holds information about what the current situation (state) is. Since our system will be constructed of many parts moving in a coordinated fashion - we want to be able to ensure we have some commonly understood idea of that state.\n",
        "\n",
        "LangGraph leverages a `StatefulGraph` which uses an `AgentState` object to pass information between the various nodes of the graph.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are more options than what we'll see below - but this `AgentState` object is one that is stored in a `TypedDict` with the key `messages` and the value is a `Sequence` of `BaseMessages` that will be appended to whenever the state changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's think about a simple example to help understand exactly what this means (we'll simplify a great deal to try and clearly communicate what state is doing):\n",
        "\n",
        "1. We initialize our state object:\n",
        "  - `{\"messages\" : []}`\n",
        "2. Our user submits a query to our application.\n",
        "  - New State: `HumanMessage(#1)`\n",
        "  - `{\"messages\" : [HumanMessage(#1)}`\n",
        "3. We pass our state object to an Agent node which is able to read the current state. It will use the last `HumanMessage` as input. It gets some kind of output which it will add to the state.\n",
        "  - New State: `AgentMessage(#1, additional_kwargs {\"function_call\" : \"WebSearchTool\"})`\n",
        "  - `{\"messages\" : [HumanMessage(#1), AgentMessage(#1, ...)]}`\n",
        "4. We pass our state object to a \"conditional node\" (more on this later) which reads the last state to determine if we need to use a tool - which it can determine properly because of our provided object!"

RAG uses a retriever to retrieve relevant information from a large corpus of text and then uses a generator to generate responses based on the retrieved information. This approach helps LLMs to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses by leveraging external knowledge.\\n\\nWhen comparing RAG and LoRA (Local Retrieval Augmented) models, it depends on the specific use case and requirements. RAG is more suitable when the model needs to access a large external corpus of text to generate responses. On the other hand, LoRA is designed for scenarios where the retrieval can be limited to a local context or a smaller set of documents.\\n\\nIn general, RAG is considered more versatile and powerful due to its ability to access a wide range of external knowledge sources. However, the choice between RAG and LoRA ultimately depends on the specific needs of the application and the available resources.',\n",
