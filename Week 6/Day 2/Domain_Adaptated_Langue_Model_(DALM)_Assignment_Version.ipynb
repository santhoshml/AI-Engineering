Not a remark-\\nable house by any means - it was about thirty years old, squattish, squarish,\\nmade of brick, and had four windows set in the front of a size and proportion\\nwhich more or less exactly failed to please the eye.\\nThe only person for whom the house was in any way special was Arthur\\nDent, and that was only because it happened to be the one he lived in. He\\nhad lived in it for about three years, ever since he had moved out of London\\nbecause it made him nervous and irritable. He was about thirty as well, dark\\nhaired and never quite at ease with himself. The thing that used to worry him\\nmost was the fact that people always used to ask him what he was looking so\\nworried about. He worked in local radio which he always used to tell his friends\\nwas a lot more interesting than they probably thought.

For instance he had spent those ﬁfteen years\\npretending to be an out of work actor, which was plausible enough.\\nHe had made one careless blunder though, because he had skimped a bit\\non his preparatory research. The information he had gathered had led him to\\nchoose the name ”Ford Prefect” as being nicely inconspicuous.\\nHe was not conspicuously tall, his features were striking but not conspicu-\\nously handsome. His hair was wiry and gingerish and brushed backwards from\\nthe temples. His skin seemed to be pulled backwards from the nose. There\\nwas something very slightly odd about him, but it was diﬃcult to say what\\nit was. Perhaps it was that his eyes didn’t blink often enough and when you\\ntalked to him for any length of time your eyes began involuntarily to water on\\nhis behalf. Perhaps it was that he smiled slightly too broadly and gave people\\nthe unnerving impression that he was about to go for their neck.\\nHe struck most of the friends he had made on Earth as an eccentric, but\\na harmless one - an unruly boozer with some oddish habits. For instance he\\nwould often gatecrash university parties, get badly drunk and start making fun\\nof any astrophysicist he could ﬁnd till he got thrown out.\\nSometimes he would get seized with oddly distracted moods and stare into\\nthe sky as if hypnotized until someone asked him what he was doing. Then he\\nwould start guiltily for a moment, relax and grin.\\n- Oh, just looking for ﬂying saucers, - he would joke and everyone would\\nlaugh and ask him what sort of ﬂying saucers he was looking for.\\n- Green ones! - he would reply with a wicked grin, laugh wildly for a moment\\nand then suddenly lunge for the nearest bar and buy an enormous round of\\ndrinks.\\nEvenings like this usually ended badly. Ford would get out of his skull on\\nwhisky, huddle into a corner with some girl and explain to her in slurred phrases\\nthat honestly the colour of the ﬂying saucers didn’t matter that much really.\\nThereafter, staggering semi-paralytic down the night streets he would often\\nask passing policemen if they knew the way to Betelgeuse. The policemen would\\nusually say something like:\\n- Don’t you think it’s about time you went oﬀ home sir?\\n- I’m trying to baby, I’m trying to, - is what Ford invariably replied on these\\noccasions.\\nIn fact what he was really looking out for when he stared distractedly into\\nthe night sky was any kind of ﬂying saucer at all. The reason he said green was\\nthat green was the traditional space livery of the Betelgeuse trading scouts.\\nFord Prefect was desperate that any ﬂying saucer at all would arrive soon\\nbecause ﬁfteen years was a long time to get stranded anywhere, particularly\\nsomewhere as mindboggingly dull as the Earth.\\nFord wished that a ﬂying saucer would arrive soon because he knew how\\nto ﬂag ﬂying saucers down and get lifts from them.

Besides the Sub-Etha\\nSens-O-Matic and the scripts he had an Electronic Thumb - a short squat black\\nrod, smooth and matt with a couple of ﬂat switches and dials at one end; he also\\nhad a device which looked rather like a largish electronic calculator.

The\\nterm Imperial is kept though it is now an anachronism. The hereditary Emperor\\nis nearly dead and has been so for many centuries. In the last moments of his\\ndying coma he was locked in a statis ﬁeld which keeps him in a state of perpetual\\nunchangingness. All his heirs are now long dead, and this means that without\\nany drastic political upheaval, power has simply and eﬀectively moved a rung or\\ntwo down the ladder, and is now seen to be vested in a body which used to act\\nsimply as advisers to the Emperor - an elected Governmental assembly headed\\nby a President elected by that assembly. In fact it vests in no such place.\\nThe President in particular is very much a ﬁgurehead - he wields no real\\npower whatsoever. He is apparently chosen by the government, but the qualities\\nhe is required to display are not those of leadership but those of ﬁnely judged\\noutrage. For this reason the President is always a controversial choice, always\\nan infuriating but fascinating character. His job is not to wield power but to\\ndraw attention away from it. On those criteria Zaphod Beeblebrox is one of the\\nmost successful Presidents the Galaxy has ever had - he has already spent two\\nof his ten Presidential years in prison for fraud. Very very few people realize\\nthat the President and the Government have virtually no power at all, and of\\nthese very few people only six know whence ultimate political power is wielded.\\nMost of the others secretly believe that the ultimate decision-making process is\\nhandled by a computer. They couldn’t be more wrong.¿\\nWhat they completely failed to understand was why Zaphod was doing it.\\nHe banked sharply, shooting a wild wall of water at the sun.\\nToday was the day; today was the day when they would realize what Zaphod\\nhad been up to. Today was what Zaphod Beeblebrox’s Presidency was all\\nabout. Today was also his two hundredth birthday, but that was just another\\nmeaningless coincidence.\\nAs he skipped his boat across the seas of Damogran he smiled quietly to\\nhimself about what a wonderful exciting day it was going to be. He relaxed and\\nspread his two arms lazily across the seat back. He steered with an extra arm\\nhe’d recently ﬁtted just beneath his right one to help improve his ski-boxing.\\n- Hey, - he cooed to himself, - you’re a real cool boy you. - But his nerves\\nsang a song shriller than a dog whistle.\\nThe island of France was about twenty miles long, ﬁve miles across the\\nmiddle, sandy and crescent shaped.

The three billion people weren’t actually there, but they\\nwatched his every gesture through the eyes of a small robot tri-D camera which\\nhovered obsequiously in the air nearby. The antics of the President always made\\namazingly popular tri-D; that’s what they were for.\\nHe grinned again. Three billion and six people didn’t know it, but today\\nwould be a bigger antic than anyone had bargained for.\\nThe robot camera homed in for a close up on the more popular of his two\\nheads and he waved again. He was roughly humanoid in appearance except\\nfor the extra head and third arm. His fair tousled hair stuck out in random\\ndirections, his blue eyes glinted with something completely unidentiﬁable, and\\nhis chins were almost always unshaven.\\nA twenty-foot-high transparent globe ﬂoated next to his boat, rolling and\\nbobbing, glistening in the brilliant sun. Inside it ﬂoated a wide semi-circular\\nsofa upholstered in glorious red leather: the more the globe bobbed and rolled,\\nthe more the sofa stayed perfectly still, steady as an upholstered rock. Again,\\nall done for eﬀect as much as anything.\\nZaphod stepped through the wall of the globe and relaxed on the sofa.

At any\\nmoment, he thought, he might scream.\\nWater boiled up beneath the bubble, it seethed and spouted. The bubble\\nsurged into the air, bobbing and rolling on the water spout.

With her red head scarf knotted in that particular\\nway and her long ﬂowing silky brown dress she looked vaguely Arabic. Not\\nthat anyone there had ever heard of an Arab of course. The Arabs had very\\nrecently ceased to exist, and even when they had existed they were ﬁve hundred\\nthousand light years from Damogran. Trillian wasn’t anybody in particular, or\\nso Zaphod claimed.

The owner of the match\\nwas not a Vogon, but he knew all about them and was right to be nervous. His\\nname was Ford Prefect.\\nFord Prefect’s original name is only pronuncible in an obscure Betelgeusian\\ndialect, now virtually extinct since the Great Collapsing Hrung Disaster of Gal.\\n/Sid./ Year 03758 which wiped out all the old Praxibetel communities on Betel-\\ngeuse Seven. Ford’s father was the only man on the entire planet to survive\\nthe Great Collapsing Hrung disaster, by an extraordinary coincidence that he\\nwas never able satisfactorily to explain. The whole episode is shrouded in deep\\nmystery: in fact no one ever knew what a Hrung was nor why it had chosen to\\ncollapse on Betelgeuse Seven particularly. Ford’s father, magnanimously waving\\naside the clouds of suspicion that had inevitably settled around him, came to\\nlive on Betelgeuse Five where he both fathered and uncled Ford; in memory of\\nhis now dead race he christened him in the ancient Praxibetel tongue.\\nBecause Ford never learned to say his original name, his father eventually\\ndied of shame, which is still a terminal disease in some parts of the Galaxy. The\\nother kids at school nicknamed him Ix, which in the language of Betelgeuse Five\\ntranslates as ”boy who is not able satisfactorily to explain what a Hrung is, nor\\nwhy it should choose to collapse on Betelgeuse Seven”¿.\\nHe looked about the cabin but could see very little; strange monstrous shad-\\nows loomed and leaped with the tiny ﬂickering ﬂame, but all was quiet. He\\nbreathed a silent thank you to the Dentrassis. The Dentrassis are an unruly\\ntribe of gourmands, a wild but pleasant bunch whom the Vogons had recently\\ntaken to employing as catering staﬀ on their long haul ﬂeets, on the strict un-\\nderstanding that they keep themselves very much to themselves.\\nThis suited the Dentrassis ﬁne, because they loved Vogon money, which is\\none of the hardest currencies in space, but loathed the Vogons themselves. The\\nonly sort of Vogon a Dentrassi liked to see was an annoyed Vogon.\\nIt was because of this tiny piece of information that Ford Prefect was not\\nnow a whiﬀ of hydrogen, ozone and carbon monoxide.\\nHe heard a slight groan. By the light of the match he saw a heavy shape\\nmoving slightly on the ﬂoor. Quickly he shook the match out, reached in his\\npocket, found what he was looking for and took it out. He crouched on the\\nﬂoor. The shape moved again.\\nFord Prefect said:\\n- I bought some peanuts.\\nArthur Dent moved, and groaned again, muttering incoherently.\\n- Here, have some, - urged Ford, shaking the packet again, - if you’ve never\\nbeen through a matter transference beam before you’ve probably lost some salt\\nand protein.

It then excretes into the mind of its carrier a telepathic matrix\\nformed by combining the conscious thought frequencies with nerve signals picked\\nup from the speech centres of the brain which has supplied them. The practical\\nupshot of all this is that if you stick a Babel ﬁsh in your ear you can instantly\\nunderstand anything said to you in any form of language. The speech patterns\\nyou actually hear decode the brainwave matrix which has been fed into your\\nmind by your Babel ﬁsh.\\n- Now it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that anything so mind-\\nboggingly useful could have evolved purely by chance that some thinkers have\\nchosen to see it as the ﬁnal and clinching proof of the non-existence of God.\\nThe argument goes something like this:\\n- I refuse to prove that I exist, - says God, - for proof denies faith, and\\nwithout faith I am nothing.\\n- But, - says Man, - The Babel ﬁsh is a dead giveaway, isn’t it?

You just won’t believe how vastly\\nhugely mindboggingly big it is. I mean you may think it’s a long way down the\\nroad to the chemist, but that’s just peanuts to space. Listen... - and so on.\\n(After a while the style settles down a bit and it begins to tell you things\\nyou really need to know, like the fact that the fabulously beautiful planet Beth-\\nselamin is now so worried about the cumulative erosion by ten billion visit-\\ning tourists a year that any net imbalance between the amount you eat and\\nthe amount you excrete whilst on the planet is surgically removed from your\\nbodyweight when you leave: so every time you go to the lavatory it is vitally\\nimportant to get a receipt.)\\nTo be fair though, when confronted by the sheer enormity of distances be-\\ntween the stars, better minds than the one responsible for the Guide’s intro-\\nduction have faltered. Some invite you to consider for a moment a peanut in\\nreading and a small walnut in Johannesburg, and other such dizzying concepts.\\nThe simple truth is that interstellar distances will not ﬁt into the human\\nimagination.\\nEven light, which travels so fast that it takes most races thousands of years\\nto realize that it travels at all, takes time to journey between the stars. It takes\\neight minutes from the star Sol to the place where the Earth used to be, and\\nfour years more to arrive at Sol’s nearest stellar neighbour, Alpha Proxima.\\nFor light to reach the other side of the Galaxy, for it to reach Damogran for\\ninstance, takes rather longer: ﬁve hundred thousand years.\\nThe record for hitch hiking this distance is just under ﬁve years, but you\\ndon’t get to see much on the way.\\nThe Hitch Hiker’s Guide to the Galaxy says that if you hold a lungful of air\\nyou can survive in the total vacuum of space for about thirty seconds. However\\nit goes on to say that what with space being the mind boggling size it is the\\nchances of getting picked up by another ship within those thirty seconds are two\\nto the power of two hundred and sixty-seven thousand seven hundred and nine\\nto one against.\\nBy a totally staggering coincidence that is also the telephone number of an\\nIslington ﬂat where Arthur once went to a very good party and met a very nice\\n49',\n",

In those days spirits\\nwere brave, the stakes were high, men were real men, women were real women,\\nand small furry creatures from Alpha Centauri were real small furry creatures\\nfrom Alpha Centauri.

There was a lot of\\ntrouble with space pirates before they were wiped out in the Dordellis wars, and\\nthe megafreighters had to be equipped with the most fantastic defence shields\\nknown to Galactic science. They were real brutes of ships, and huge. In orbit\\nround a planet they would eclipse the sun.\\n- One day, young Zaphod here decides to raid one.
